## Why Use This Project?

In modern MEP systems, **inefficiency** in energy consumption can lead to increased costs, system malfunctions, and higher carbon footprints. By using **Machine Learning**, this project can:
  
- **Predict Energy Usage**: Helps optimize energy consumption through accurate forecasting.
- **Identify Anomalies**: Detects issues early and flags system inefficiencies, saving costs.
- **Enhance Sustainability**: Contributes to a greener, more sustainable operation by lowering overall energy waste.

## How This Project Works

1. **Energy Consumption Prediction**  
   The project uses historical energy data to train a **Linear Regression** model, which predicts future energy usage based on variables such as temperature, occupancy, and time of day.

2. **Anomaly Detection**  
   The **Isolation Forest** algorithm detects unusual energy consumption patterns, signaling possible inefficiencies or malfunctions that need attention.
